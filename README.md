A very simple polynomial calculator, made for a university assignment where the Python programming language was being introduced to the students.

This calculator is capable of parsing polynomials from input, dealing with:
  - Integer coefficients and powers in polynomials;
  - Sum and subtraction arithmetic operations;
  - Multivariable expressions;
  - Standalone integer values;
  
Operations performed by polRefactor are:
  - Simplification/factorization of polynomials;
  - Calculation of integrals and derivatives with respect to every variable;
  - Addition of an arbitrary number of polynomials to an expression;
  
The parser contained in polRefactor is handwritten and currently supports inputs of terms like:
